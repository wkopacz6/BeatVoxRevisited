# BeatVoxRevisited
BeatVOX is an application that I, along with John Kasun, Connor Dowd, and Josh Chan created as a class project for Dr. Lerch at Georgia Tech. The goal of the product is to serve as a way for someone to convert vocal percussion or beatboxing into MIDI drum beats. This would allow music creators who do not have access to a drum kit or drummer to convert their ideas into a sonic medium using the most intuitive musical instrument there is: the human voice. The goal of BeatVoxRevisted is to take a fresh look at this problem. When we origially took on the projcet it was our first time ever using JUCE or C++ or even creating an audio application of this scale. We have all learned a lot since then and we would like to take that knowledge to rejuvenate this project. We hope you enjoy the work!

## New goals for the project
* Refactor to use modern C++ and JUCE best practices
* Recreate GUI to be more interactive and aesthetically pleasing 
* Explore more advanced ML techniques for audio segmentation and classification
